# How to contribute to the VerneMQ Project and the VerneMQ Mission

## What is VerneMQ?
VerneMQ is a fully open-source, clusterable MQTT message broker, written in Erlang/OTP.

## What is the VerneMQ Mission?
The VerneMQ Mission is to give the IoT (and IIoT) the open, industrial-strength messaging solution that the IoT needs in almost all of its use cases. Open, simple and effective.

We welcome any kind of contribution: documentation, fixing bugs, adding features, writing tests, opening issues, having discussions and fun.


Here are some possible next steps for you:

  * Open an Issue [Github Issues](https://github.com/vernemq/vernemq/issues)
  * Join our new Mailing list [VerneMQ user list](http://groups.google.com/group/vernemq-users/)
  * Join the new VerneMQ Community Team, by sending us your Github name, so that we can invite you. We'll use the Github Discussion board will for feature and roadmap discussions.

If your issue is related to one of the subprojects of VerneMQ, please open an issue in those repositories.
 

## Testing

If you propose a feature in a Pull Request, make sure to add tests for your feature. It is also good practice to talk to us about the feature itself before you start implementing.

## Submitting changes

If you open a Pull Request, there will be a Pull Request Template. Its purpose is to help not to hinder. If you don't find it helpful, adapt it.
